# weather-dashboard
Created a simple weather dashboard using html, css, boostrap, javascript and the jQuery library.

    A user can search a certain city to find the current weather and 5 day forecast.
    Search queries are saved in the browser's localStorage that each time the user returns they can see and click their previous history search terms.
